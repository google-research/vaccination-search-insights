        "about_data_content": "You can use this data to compare search interest between topics related to COVID-19 vaccination and see what topics are popular or rising. The value for search interest isn’t an absolute number of searches—it’s a value representing relative interest which we scale to make it easier to compare regions with one another, or the same region over time. If you’d like to know more about our calculation and process, see our <a href=\"{aboutDataUrl}\">technical docs.</a>",

You can’t conclude that a community is suffering from many side effects because there’s increased interest in the safety and side effects category.</p>",

Additionally, we don’t show data for regions that are smaller than 3 km<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>To learn more about the privacy methods used to generate the data, read the <a href=\"{anonymizationUrl}\">anonymization process description</a>.</p>",
